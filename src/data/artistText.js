export const maxineText = "Maxine has been tattooing for 8 years now, two of which she’s been the fearless leader and owner of Lucky 13 Tattoo Parlour. Her passion for tattooing is unmistakable and can be proven by the vastness of her style capabilities, though her heart remains with neo-traditional and Japanese designs. When she isn’t drawing floral, moths or animal skulls for fun she can usually be found somewhere within a close distance to a donut or live music (or both). Maxine tells dad jokes better than your dad does, even your dad would agree. Come on in and find out why the coffee filed a police report. (Clue: it got mugged)."
export const jessyText = "Jessy has been an artist as long as she can remember and in the last four years, she’s finally put that art to skin. Hailing from Lyon, Paris, Jessy has been fortunate enough to have tattooed all over the world, gracing international bodies with her signature female empowered likenesses as well as her sought after plant, flower and animal work. She is proficient in both colour and blackwork and would describe her style as “beautifully dark”. She’s as passionate about saving our planet as Leonardo DiCaprio so we love her even more than him, and that’s saying something." 
export const jesseText = "Jesse is newer to the tattooing game but her quality of work suggests she may have been a tattoo artist in a past life. Jesse is up for doing more of any style but has recently excelled at creating some of the punniest tattoos our shop has ever seen. To Jesse, no animal should have to exist shirtless or without a slice of pizza in hand. Cute—is an understatement! "
